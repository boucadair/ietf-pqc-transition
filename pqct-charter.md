# <insert WG Name>

 ## Charter
Continued advancements in the capabilities of quantum computers will reduce or compromise assurances provided by many widely deployed cryptographic algorithms, especially those relying on public key cryptography. Many IETF protocols currently rely on these vulnerable cryptographic mechanisms.  Outside of the IETF, active work is underway to develop and validate Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) mechanisms expected to be resilient to the cryptanalysis capabilities of future quantum computing environments.  Select IETF WGs (e.g., LAMPS, TLS, IPSECME, COSE) have already begun standardizing specific protocol behavior.  The focus of this WG is to support this growing body of work in the IETF to facilitate the evolution of IETF protocols and associated operational guidance to PQC.

The WG will provide a standing venue to discuss PQC transition issues that cross WGs.  The WG will also provide a venue of last resort to discuss PQC-related issues in IETF protocols that have no associated maintenance WGs. This WG will not update existing protocols, specify new protocols, define new cryptographic mechanisms, or assess whether a given cryptographic mechanism is quantum resistant.

As a result of this discussion, the WG will document operational and design guidance which supports PQC transition. The general process of elaboration through documentation will be for issues to be identified and discussed on the mailing list, and presentations made at WG meetings. When topics merit more coherent documentation, the WG will adopt working group documents to capture the information in Internet-Drafts. If the working group consensus is that the material of the Internet-Draft is generally useful for archival purposes, the WG will seek publication of the work items as RFCs. At any point, from early discussion of topics through later documentation stages, the WG may identify a more appropriate WG for the matter, and with coordination, dispatch it there .

The IESG is establishing this working group on an experimental basis, and in 2 years, the IESG intends to review it, for rechartering to continue or else closure.

 ## Milestones
* Informational document that defines terminology for hybrid PQC schemes
